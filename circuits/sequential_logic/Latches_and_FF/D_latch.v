Implement the following circuit:
Note that this is a latch, so a Quartus warning about having inferred a latch is expected.

module top_module (
    input d, 
    input ena,
    output q);
    always @(*) begin
        if(ena)
            q <= d;
        else 
            q <= q;
    end
    
endmodule
